                <h2> The Alien </h2>

                <p>
                    You reduced speed but you need to do some quick calculations to fix your trajectory!
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Perform the following calculations:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> 2 x 2 </li>
                    <li> 4 / 2 </li>
                    <li> 5 - 5 </li>
                    <li> 6 + 2 </li>
                </ul>
            

                <p> You decide to keep these calculations close by. You have a feeling they could be useful later. </p>

                <p> 
                    After figuring out your calculations you adjust your trajectory. Everything looks great. As you begin to approach the ring you get a strange feeling.
                    It feels like someone is watching you. When you finally arrive at the ring a being emerges and approaches your ship! The being does not seem to be wearing
                    any kind of protective space suit. Was this first contact with alien life? You're thrilled and terrified at the same time. At first glance it seems like the 
                    being is glowing. As it draws closer you hear a voice inside your head. The alien is speaking to you telepathically!
