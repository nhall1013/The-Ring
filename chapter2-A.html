                <p>
                You max out your engines to full burn and begin your trip home. It looks like you're home free! Suddenly chaos breaks out! It sounds like every sensor in the ship
                is going off. You open a live feed of the rear view camera on your display. Bright green beams burst out of the aliens eyes heading right for you. You reach for the  
                throttle so you can increase speed, but you're already at max speed! The beams overtake you and consume your ship. You have died.
