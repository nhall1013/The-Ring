                    Suddenly you're awake. You can't breathe. Why can't you breathe? You begin coughing up fluid. How long have you been asleep? As you begin to regain your bearings your memory slowly
                    returns. The ring! It's been two years since the ring first appeared. Your name? Why can't you remember your name? Side-effects! Memory loss is a side effect of the hibernation pod fluid. 
                    More memories start to return... As you make your way out of your pod more details come flooding in. You're Captain of the USS New Orleans. You began training for your first contact expeditionary
                    mission two years ago when a mysterious ring appeared near Jupiter. No one knew what to expect. The ring had appeared so suddenly. One thing our experts were sure of was that the ring
                    was placed by a life form not from our galaxy. An hour after the ring appeared your commanding officer, Admiral Ted Holmberg, contacted you.

                    <i>"We're sending a one man expeditionary ship out to the ring. After deliberation we decided you were the best candidate for the job. You'll only have one year to train. Command wants someone in
                    route to the ring as soon as possible. How bout it Captain? Oh! One more thing before you answer... This may be a one way trip."</i>

                    One year to train. One year to travel to the ring. It was the easiest decision you ever made. Whether it was a good one remains to be seen...

                    You notice a sensor flashing at the pilots chair. You sit down and start retrieving diagnostic information. The log says you're approaching the ring and your speed is too high, but
                    if you approach the ring too slow you may disrupt your trajectory and miss the ring. What do you do?
