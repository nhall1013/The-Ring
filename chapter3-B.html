                    <i>"So you got the first one correct? This next question will stop you for sure! On your approach to "the ring", as the humans like to call it, you had to perform some
                    calculations to correct your trajectory. List the solutions to those calculations in order from the first calculation you made to the last."</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    How was this possible? How could this being possibly know that? How long had it known of your arrival? Then again, it was speaking to you inside your own head.
