                <p>
                    The alien had a maniacal look on his face. You begin to worry that you may not be able to answer all of his questions. You hear the voice in your head again.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <i>"You must answer all three questions. If you answer all three correctly then you may go. If you answer one of the questions incorrectly we will not only 
                    destroy you but we will destroy all of planet Earth."</i>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The nerves were really starting to creep in now. Your mind begins to race. How could you possibly answer one of the aliens questions? But then pure dread overcomes
                    you with the thought of having to answer all three of them correctly.
                </p>

                <p> You can save Earth if you can answer all three questions! If you return back to this page after answering questions 1 and 2 then you answered correctly. 
                    If you fail Earth will be destroyed!
