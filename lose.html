                    You answered a question incorrectly! The alien begins to laugh because he knows that he has won. The ring begins to shake wildy as a blinding light explodes
                    from the center of it. You look back as the powerful beam of light starts to overtake you. The last vision you see is Earth being disintegrated.
                    You have died!
